# MiniLang Scanner

The MiniLang Scanner is a Python implementation of a scanner for the MiniLang programming language. MiniLang is a simple language designed to demonstrate key programming concepts, including basic arithmetic operations, variable assignments, if-else conditions, and print statements.

## Features
- Tokenization of MiniLang source code according to language specifications.
- Recognition of different types of tokens such as integers, boolean literals, operators, keywords, identifiers, and comments.
- Error handling for lexical errors such as invalid symbols or malformed identifiers.

## Getting Started
To use the MiniLang Scanner, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/MiniLang-Scanner.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the repository directory:**
   ```
   cd MiniLang-Scanner
   ```

3. **Run the scanner with a test file containing MiniLang source code:**
   ```
   python minilang_scanner.py test.minilang
   ```

4. **The scanner will tokenize the MiniLang source code and print the list of tokens.**

## Test Cases
The repository includes test cases in the `test.minilang` file. These test cases cover various aspects of the MiniLang language and can be used to validate the correctness and robustness of the scanner implementation.
